# Disk-Algorithm-Visualizer

This project provides a web-based tool to compare various disk scheduling algorithms, such as **FCFS**, **SSTF**, **SCAN**, **C-SCAN**, **LOOK**, and **C-LOOK**. It calculates the total head movement for each algorithm and visualizes the results using a bar chart for easy comparison.

**Features:**
**Compare Algorithms:** Compare popular disk scheduling algorithms to see which minimizes head movement.

**Interactive Form:** Input disk request sequence and initial head position to get results.

**Bar Chart Visualization:** Visualize the total head movement for each algorithm.

**Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop and mobile screens.

**Technologies Used:**
**HTML:** For basic webpage structure.

**CSS:** For styling and layout.

**JavaScript:** To handle the disk scheduling logic and interactivity.

**Chart.js:** To display the bar chart visualizing algorithm performance.

**Bootstrap 4:** For responsive layout and components.

**Disk Scheduling Algorithms Included:**
FCFS (First Come First Serve)
SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
SCAN
C-SCAN
LOOK
C-LOOK

**How to Use:**

1.**Enter Disk Request Sequence:** Input a comma-separated list of disk requests (e.g., 98,183,37,122,14,124,65,67).

2.**Enter Initial Head Position:** Input the initial head position (e.g., 53).

3.**Click Compare:** The comparison results and bar chart will display the total head movement for each algorithm.
